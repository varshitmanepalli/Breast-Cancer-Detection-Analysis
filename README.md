# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores and analyzes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict whether breast cancer is benign or malignant based on various attributes derived from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes features such as the radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension of the cell nuclei present in the images.

## Methods
The notebook performs the following operations:
* Data loading and preprocessing: Preparing the dataset for analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the distribution of data and relationships between features.
* Model Building: Applying Logistic Regression to classify the tumor as benign or malignant.
* Model Evaluation: Using accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance.

## Results
The analysis applies Logistic Regression and evaluates its accuracy using a confusion matrix and cross-validation. Results are detailed at the end of the notebook, including accuracy percentages and statistical evaluations.
